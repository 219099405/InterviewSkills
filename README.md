<h1>INTERVIEW SKILLS </h1>



<h2>REFLECTION WITH STAR TECHNIQUE</h2>
<br>
Situation:
I took part in a workshop focused on Interview Skills, which covered techniques for preparing for interviews, answering questions confidently, and making a positive impression.
<br/>

<br>
Task:
My goal was to develop the ability to present myself effectively during interviews by highlighting my strengths, experiences, and suitability for the job.
<br />

<br>
Action:
During the workshop, I practiced common interview questions using the STAR method and learned how to structure responses clearly. I also received feedback on body language, tone of voice, and eye contact. I prepared a short self-introduction and learned strategies for researching companies and understanding job descriptions before interviews.
<br />

<br>
Result:
After completing the workshop, I felt more prepared and confident about handling interviews. I now understand how to structure my responses, stay calm under pressure, and project confidence. I’m able to present my skills and experiences in a professional and convincing way that aligns with the role I’m applying for.
